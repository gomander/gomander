# Welcome to my Github profile!
My name is Gunnar Omander, and I work as a web developer on [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com). I primarily develop in Vue.js for Wheel of Names, and that's what I'm most familiar with.

I am also responsible for the Wheel of Names [Discord bot](https://wheelofnames.com/faq/discordbot), made with Discord.js. The bot has been added to over 6000 servers worldwide!

Languages I am confident in:
1. NodeJS
2. Python
3. Java
